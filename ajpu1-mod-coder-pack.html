Quick PSA since this has bitten me three times, once in each mod I'm active in right now. --- In 1.12, the old `AxisAlignedBB.expand` method was renamed (https://github.com/ModCoderPack/MCPBot-Issues/issues/302) to `AxisAlignedBB.grow`, but another method with the same signature, `AxisAlignedBB.addCoord`, took the old name of `AxisAlignedBB.expand`. This means mods that use `expand` will transparently recompile with a new method with different semantics, introducing hidden bugs. Modders. Слово 'мод' происходит от слова модификация и означает модифицирование режима оригинальной игры, в чем Minecraft Coder Pack нам и поможет, ведь это инструмент для создания. 
 So the optifine forums updated today stating that they have not begun working on optifine 1.12 because of the Mod Coder Pack not being updated to 1.12 either thus making it impossible to start working on a compatible version of 1.12.

The MCP tool has been given permission to run by Mojang (it is technically against the EULA). However, I’m We have moved our releases to the MCP wiki. The latest version can be found here: Downloads You can also meet the team and a lot of other cool people. For MCP Alpha 1.2.6 it is suggested that reobf-fix is used, it is for fixing reobfuscation. I've been modding older versions of Minecraft and this version of MCP gets stuck on reobfuscating for me, but I can't use reobf-fix because it was hosted on the old MCP website and is no longer there, I also cannot find it rehosted anywhere.

I'm just a bit worried because it seems so far that everything relies on them downloading something and we've had issues with viruses. Download links for the K-Lite Codec Pack. A free software bundle for high quality audio and video playback. I've looked all over the internet for videos, but none of the instructional links seem to be fore 1.7.4 (even though they say they are) and most of the youtube videos are in other languages, and also aren't for 1.7.4 (even though they say they are).
